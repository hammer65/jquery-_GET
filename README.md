# jquery-_GET
This jQuery plugin will add a _GET() function to jQuery which will return an object with the query string values of the current page and all script linked to javascript files. If a script tag has an "id" attribute the values will be available in a property which matches the id. If an id is not present, the file name (without the extension) will be used as the property name. The test directory contains an index.html file with tests for every type of query string name/value pair variety and examples of how to use these values in your code. Any bug fixes or ideas for improvement are welcome.
